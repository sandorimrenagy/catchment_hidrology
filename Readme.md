# *Catchment hidrology*

## This is a small project of environmental chemical compounds' analysis.

There where several sampling sites ("site_id") where samples were taken from creeks and rivers. These sampling sites belong to two catchment areas ("location"): north ("É") and south ("D"). Samples were taken several times (at least most of them) over the span of two years ("year"). Then, samples were tested for the concentration (μg/l) of different chemical substances, belonging to PPCPs (pharmaceuticals and personal care products) or pesticids.

### Our goal:
- We compared PPCPs and pesticids separately
- We wanted to compare whether there were any differences between the catchment areas (É vs D)
- Was there any difference between the years: 2021 vs 2022
- Both in terms of concantrations of the compounds and the number of above-threshold measurements at the given site and time
